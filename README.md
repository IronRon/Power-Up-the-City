# ⚡ Power Up the City

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Type:** Standalone XR Experience

**SDG Focus:** SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy  

**Concept:**  
*Power Up the City* is an interactive XR experience that lets users transform a polluted, fossil-fuel-powered city into a clean, sustainable environment. The user explores a small virtual city where “dirty” energy sources—coal plants, oil generators, diesel units—emit smog and unpleasant sounds. Using hand tracking and spatial awareness, the user locates these sources through their distinct rumbling audio cues.  

Once found, the player picks up and installs renewable replacements such as solar panels, wind turbines, hydro systems, and battery storage. As each swap is completed, the city visually improves: smog clears, trees grow, lights turn on, and real-life energy facts appear in floating 3D panels (e.g., *“Replacing a coal plant with solar saves 2,300 tons of CO₂/year”*).  

The experience encourages players to see the tangible benefits of clean energy, making climate awareness interactive and rewarding.

## 🎯 SDG Alignment

**SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy**  
This project supports SDG 7 by promoting awareness of renewable energy technologies and demonstrating their environmental impact in a visual, hands-on way. The experience reinforces the message that small changes—switching from fossil fuels to clean energy—create large-scale environmental improvement.

## 🧩 Key Features and Interactions

- **Hand-tracked Energy Replacement:**  
  Pick up and place clean energy sources using natural hand movements.  
- **Spatial Audio Cues:**  
  Listen for rumbling, buzzing, or coughing sounds to locate dirty energy sources.  
- **Environmental Transformation:**  
  City visuals shift from smoggy to vibrant as clean energy is installed.  
- **3D Stat Panels:**  
  Floating text appears to show real-life clean energy facts after each replacement.  
- **Gamified Feedback:**  
  A “City Health” bar fills as more clean energy sources are placed.

## 🧠 XR Technologies Used

- **Hand Tracking:** For grabbing, carrying, and placing energy modules.  
- **Spatial Audio:** For locating dirty sources and hearing environmental improvement.  
- **3D UI Panels:** For displaying clean energy facts and feedback.  
- **Particle and Shader Effects:** For visual changes (smog clearing, trees growing).  
- **Physics Interactions:** For realistic object placement and motion.
